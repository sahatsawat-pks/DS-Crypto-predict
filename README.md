   ```

2. **Access the web interface** at `http://localhost:8501` in your browser

### Using the Application

1. **Basic Setup**:
   - Enter a cryptocurrency symbol (e.g., `BTC-USD`, `ETH-USD`, `SOL-USD`)
   - Select training and prediction periods
   - Choose sequence length for time series analysis

2. **Advanced Configuration**:

## üìä Model Details

### Available Models

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Excellent for capturing long-term dependencies in time series data
- **Bidirectional LSTM**: Processes sequences in both forward and backward directions
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**: Similar to LSTM but with a simpler architecture
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble learning method for regression tasks

### Optimization

The application optionally uses **Keras Tuner** to find optimal hyperparameters:
- Number of LSTM/GRU units
- Dropout rates
- Learning rates
- Number of layers
- Optimizer selection
